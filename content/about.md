NoVault is a password utility that derives new unique passwords on the
fly. Your team can use the same password for different resources. A
resource can be a domain (example.com) or any string value. This
combination allows you to create secure passwords that aren't centrally
stored. NoVault means no attack surface. Everything happens in your browser,
nothing is sent to any server.

Some websites have specific password requirements but
NoVault might not meet all of those requirements. This
doesn't mean the generated password is insecure. You may
need to devise a convention to handle these cases.

All of the code is opensource and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/levidurfee/novault).
